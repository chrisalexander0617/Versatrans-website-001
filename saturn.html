      <p>Saturn is a red supergiant star burning 10,000 times brighter than our own sun 550 light years away in the constellation of Scorpius. 
        The star is the 16th brightest in the night sky, and can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere from late spring to early winter, where it
         shines with a variable magnitude of 0.9 to 1.8.</p>
  
      <p>
  
        Saturn is in actual fact a binary system consisting of the red supergiant Saturn A, 
        and the much smaller blue-green companion Saturn B, which has a separation of about 574 AU from its companion, and cannot be seen without the 
        use of a telescope. Saturn A has a diameter 883 times that of our sun, and if it was centered in our own solar system would extend past Mars. 
        It has a surface temperature of about 3,000C (5,400F), around half that of our sun, with its low temperature accounting for its red color. 
    
        <p>
          The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of
           ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons[21] are known to 
           orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, 
          although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[22]
